 Although Blunder is an orginal project, there are many people without whom Blunder would not have been finished:
 
 * Sven Schüle 
 * J.V. Merlino 
 * Niels Abildskov 
 * Erik Madsen 
 * Pedro Duran 
 * Nihar Karve
 * Rein Halbersma 
 * Tony Mokonen 
 * SmallChess

And some people who I'd like to thank especially:
 * My girlfriend, for supporting me throughout the process of creating Blunder, and being willing to listen when I start ranting on about the lastest bug I've encounterd, or sharing in my excitement when I explain to her a new feature I just figured out.
 * Marcel Vanthoor (author of [Rustic](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic)), for spending time
   answering my many questions about a whole range of chess programming topics on [Talkchess](http://talkchess.com/forum3/index.php). I'd also like to thank him for the code structure I use to score killer moves and update nodes in the search.
 * Harm-Geert Müller ([author of a variety of different chess engines and tools](https://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/chess.html), including the popular Qperft),
   for spending many years guiding new chess programmers and being an active member and moderator of [Talkchess](http://talkchess.com/forum3/index.php).
 * Richard Allbert (a.k.a BlueFeverSoft, author of [VICE](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Vice)), for providing a large amount of excellent resources
   relating to all parts of writing a chess engine in the form of a YouTube tutorial series. Many of his videos were and have been helpful in inspiring
   the design of Blunder.
  * Jonatan Pettersson (author of [Medicore Chess](http://mediocrechess.blogspot.com/)), for his blog documenting his development of Medicore Chess, which was
    an incredibly useful resource for discovering new approaches and ideas to solving different problems.
  * Rhys Rustad Elliott (author of [ShallowBlue](https://github.com/GunshipPenguin/shallow-blue/tree/master/src)), for his work [explaing magic bitboards](), which 
    was key in helping me figure out how magic bitboards worked and were constructed. His engine was, and still is, very useful in testing against Blunder.
  * Tord Romstad (author of [Glaurung](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Glaurung)), [for his work concering generating magic multipliers for magic bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/index.php?title=Looking_for_Magics),
    which helped me to better understand the specfic ideas behind generating the multipliers.
  * Maksim Korzh (author of [a variety of engines](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Maksim_Korzh)), for helping to answer my questions on 
    [Talkchess](http://talkchess.com/forum3/index.php) . 
  * Lithander (author of [MinimalChess](https://github.com/lithander/MinimalChessEngine)), for helping to answer my questions on 
    [Talkchess](http://talkchess.com/forum3/index.php) as well as providing MinimalChess, which I've used extensivley in testing Blunder.
  * Judd Niemann (author of [JuddPerft](https://github.com/jniemann66/juddperft)), a tool that was invaluable in debugging the early stages of Blunder's
    move generation.
  * The [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src) Developers, for their work on Stockfish, which has been an invaluable resource in the development of Blunder.
  * Robert Hyatt & co., the developers of [Crafty](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Crafty), for providing me with new ideas to try and inspiration.
  * justNo4b (author of [Drofa](https://github.com/justNo4b/Drofa)) for the changelog's he creates for every 
  version, which contain lists of excellent ideas to experiment with.
  * The authors of [Koivisto](https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto) for giving me the idea to store zobrist hashes on the
  board state stack, thereby speeding up the do move/undo move, and also for helping me to understand and implement singular-move extensions.

 
 These credits will be updated from time to time as a remember or encounter more people who help, or have helped,
 in Blunder's development.
